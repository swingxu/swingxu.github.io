Hello! I’m Thawne. I‘m a graduate student in Electronic Engineering at [Southern University of Science and Technology ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_University_of_Science_and_Technology)(Jointly educated with [Harbin Institute of Technology ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology "Harbin Institute of Technology")).  I receive my B.A. in Biomedical Engineering  at [Beijing Institute of Technology ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology "Harbin Institute of Technology").  Most of my work during  postgraduate period has focus on accelerating deep learning in algorithm level and hardware-level. I proposed LUT-based CNN which replace all the multiplication operations with LOOK-UP in CNN.  Only single tiny LUT(\<1MB) is needed for DNN(ResNet/AlexNet) inference. Experiments show that only slightly performance drop (\<1%) in ImageNet classification task and achieve nearly 4.5GOP/s computation throughput while save 54.4% resource utilization in FPGA implementation(PYNQ-Z2). 
I also have some side project in the school. I develop a wechat mini program named Artia which can blend the portraits of people into world-famous painting based on human matting technique and GAN based style transfer technique. This project won the best technology prize in DEECAMP(an global AI camp held by KAIFU LI) and was reported by well-known tech media([Detail](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/I3aK_WI6WKf5hlpF-IFyKQ)). I also build a crowd-counting system based on EM9D dev kit which can count the heads of people instantly in the edge. This project won the 3rd prize of HUAWEI CUP(A national chip design competition ).
